            <p>When I'm not pretending to be a bloodthirsty, undead pirate hunting my 4 year-old son, I'm usually hunched over a computer, eyes bloodshot with my index finger twitching and drool forming in the corner of my mouth.</p> 
		
			<p>
				Like many zombies, I'm slowly conforming to life in suburbia. It took over a year to discover that we have neighbors and that they are friendly. I have mastered the art of smiling and waving to them as I drive by, wondering if I should be removing weeds in our yard like they seem to do every day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite activity is playing video games with my son. I believe this is generally frowned upon by society, but I'm determined to raise the best zombie I can. Video games are an important part of zombie life.
